The goal of marketing is driving a profitable customer action and reaching as the target audience in the most efficient way 

I wanted to explore another industry, and I have always thought that marketing might be a challenging but a very usefell 
industry to work in, in terms of improving my skills and knowledge, especially now in an era of marketing dominance 
with the importance of social media platforms in our everyday life.


I especially like the idea  that the company's concept is betting againt the market trend and not relying on social media 
which is different i believe only a few companies do so, therefor it is a challenge i really want to be a part of.
